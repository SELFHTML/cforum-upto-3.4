	* src/modules/flt_mailonpost.c: Fixed bug, flt_mailonpost_udb has to be equal
		NULL if FLT_DECLINE should returned, not non-NULL
	* src/modules/flt_syntax.c: Made parser more tollerant, now it also recognizes
		"lang" and 'lang' and so on
	* src/perl/Plugins/ImportExport.pm: Changed import behavior, unknown
		directives will be ignored

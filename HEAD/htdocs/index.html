<h1>Classic Forum</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
   The <strong>Classic Forum</strong> is a web based forum project
   designed for high performance, scalability and customization. It's
   a <strong>classic</strong> thread based forum implemented in C
   and Perl. It has been successfully tested with FreeBSD and Linux but
   should also run on other Unizes. It has been written from scratch
   for the german <a href="http://selfhtml.teamone.de/">SELFHTML
   Project</a> and is productive since version 1.0 which came out last
   quartal 2002.

  <h2>Under The Hood</h2>
<p>
   The <strong>Classic Forum</strong> follows a client-server based
   concept using UNIX sockets for fast communication between the
   server and the client. It optionally provides the use of shared
   memory to accellerate the communication. The server program has the
   whole data in memory, so there is no need for the client software
   to parse the data again and again. In a defined interval the data
   will be written to disk using XML for preventing loss of data. Of
   course the client and the server are running on the same machine,
   there is no need for the user to install additionally software. He
   only needs a web browser. It also has an easy-to-use plugin API
   which makes it easy to implement new features.
  </p>
